Contains the Final Project for Object-Oriented Programming I

This project is a simple game of Blackjack utilizing object-oriented programming skills picked up from the course.

I built this project as an extension of a previous project, a simple game of 21. That project used a single array of values and had no capability to hit or stand, nor
did it have a dealer to play against.

This project utilized an array of objects to represent the cards, had a dealer with simple AI, and allowed the player to choose whether to hit or stand.
Additionally, this project has simple logic to determine the value of an Ace card in either hand when totalling the hand size.
